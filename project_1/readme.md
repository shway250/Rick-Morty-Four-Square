THis experience was great. I want to work on making my code Dryer, since a lot of my code was doubled just to accomodate two players, and I'm sure some of my logic could have been simplified as well. I think many of my anonymous functions could also be abstracted into named functions, that way my code could just be a bunch of functions that I call at the bottom of the code.

Something I would love to do in the future out be to make the Winner message look more professional and I'd love to add sounds to a bunch of different parts of the game. I also want to add some credits for the art and whatnot before I start showing this for job interviews or posting it around the internet
